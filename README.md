## About


CommHub is a communication hub to be able to text your friends, family, anyone you like!


Intrigued in the ability to respond to messages on your computer, given by Apple's Apple Ecosystemâ„¢, I want the same functionality for my computer with my android phone. 


Using [Twilio's communication API](https://www.twilio.com/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/), you are able to use a verified Twilio number to send and recieve messages in real time!
